        "# **Residual Networks (ResNet)**\n",
        "At the heart of their proposed residual network (ResNet) is the idea that every additional layer should more easily contain the identity function as one of its elements. These considerations are rather profound but they led to a surprisingly simple solution, a residual block. With it, ResNet won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2015. The design had a profound influence on how to build deep neural networks."
